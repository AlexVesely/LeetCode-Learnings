4. Dynamic Programming (DP)
DP is one of the most crucial topics for coding assessments.

Memoization (Top-down approach)
Tabulation (Bottom-up approach)
Common DP problems:
    Fibonacci numbers
    Knapsack problem
    Longest Common Subsequence
    Longest Increasing Subsequence
    Minimum Edit Distance
    Coin Change

6. Greedy Algorithms
Greedy problems often appear, like:
Activity Selection
Huffman Coding
Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal/Prim)


8. Bit Manipulation
Check if a number is a power of 2.
Count the number of 1s in binary representation.
Find the single non-repeating number in an array.

9. Math Problems
Prime checking (Sieve of Eratosthenes)
GCD and LCM
Modular arithmetic
Fast exponentiation

10. Practice Problem Themes
Array manipulation (e.g., "maximum subarray sum").
StringLearning manipulation (e.g., "longest palindrome substring").
Matrix problems (e.g., rotate a matrix).
Graph-based puzzles (e.g., "number of islands").
Combination/permutation generation.
